I doesn't have much experience working on CLI applications so I just made a simple react application for this demo.

## Dependencies
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to Run

### `npm install`
Installs all the libraries/dependencies included in this project

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## To Do's

Track each user limits per week to apply correct commission on cash out tranactions beyond the weekly limit
